     <h1><strong>MY HOBBY</strong></h1>
    <p>My hobby is basically Singing.</p>
    <p>I feel relaxed,reduced stress,anxiety and increase feelings of trust,well-being,inner peace and joy whenever i am singing.</p>
<p>I have not really had oppourtunity to travel to another state just to go and sing, however i have been oppourtuned to sing and lead worship sessions in my local church here in Lagos. It is always a sweet and refreshing moment whenever i do so.<br> Also, i sing whenever i get to do chores, with friends and sometimes compose little lyrics which i love to do more. People who hear me sing always admire my voice when i sing and that gives me encouragement to do more.</p>
